# osciiliscope-logic_analyzer
Nelson Yeap

This project is the creation of an oscilliscope and logic analyzer through use of a PSOC5 and an Raspberry Pi. 
The oscilliscope is a 2 channel oscilliscope in which analog signals are read into the PSOC and then transferred to the Pi.
The Pi then processes this data and outputs it to a monitor where the user can then look at and observe voltages coming into the PSOC

This project also includes a logic analyzer which uses a similar algorithm to read in data from the PSOC and output the data from the Pi
